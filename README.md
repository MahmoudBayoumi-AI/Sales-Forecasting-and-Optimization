# Sales Forecasting and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict future sales for retail and e-commerce businesses using historical data. It involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series forecasting, model optimization, and deployment with MLOps.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gather historical sales data with relevant features (date, promotions, holidays, weather).
- Perform EDA to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.
- Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and engineer time-based features.

### 2. Data Analysis & Visualization
- Conduct statistical analysis to examine relationships between sales and external factors.
- Create interactive visualizations to explore trends and seasonal patterns.

### 3. Forecasting Model Development
- Implement and compare time-series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM).
- Optimize models using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.

### 4. MLOps, Deployment & Monitoring
- Use MLflow for experiment tracking and DVC for data versioning.
- Deploy the model with Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
- Monitor model performance and detect drift for continuous improvement.

### 5. Documentation & Presentation
- Prepare a final report summarizing findings, challenges, and insights.
- Develop a stakeholder presentation showcasing the forecasting model's impact.
